      <p>
        This application is a demo of how to create a navigation bar using React
        Router. It allows users to navigate between different pages such as
        Home, About, Products, and Contact.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app is built with React and uses the `useNavigate` hook to handle
        navigation between routes. It's designed to be a simple demonstration of
        client-side routing and navigation in a single-page application.
      </p>
