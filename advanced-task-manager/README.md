# Advanced Task Manager

The Advanced Task Manager is a simple web application built with React that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. The application interacts with a JSON server to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks. Each task has a title, completion status, and an assignee.

## Features

- Add New Task: Create new tasks with a title, assignee, and completion status.
- Update Existing Task: Modify the title, completion status, and assignee of existing tasks.
- Delete Task: Remove tasks from the list.
- Show All Tasks: Display all tasks stored on the server.
- Show Incomplete Tasks: Filter and display only tasks that are not completed.
- Filter Tasks by Assignee: Filter tasks based on the assignee's name.

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser to make requests to the JSON server.
- JSON Server: A simple fake REST API server to store and manage tasks.
