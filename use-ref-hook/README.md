# Exploring useRef Hooks

This project is a simple React application created using `create-react-app`. The project includes three primary components that demonstrate the use of the `useRef` hook to manage DOM elements and inputs.

## Components

1. ### FocusableInput

   This component renders an input field that automatically receives focus when the component mounts.

2. ### UncontrolledInput

   This component demonstrates managing an uncontrolled input field using useRef. It displays the current value of the input field in real-time as the user types.

3. ### InteractiveElement

   This component interacts with a DOM element directly using useRef and changes its background color when the element is clicked.
